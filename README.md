# SCILEARN---Web-Development-Project
Developed an interactive web application, "SCILEARN" designed to educate children with learning disabilities about space in an engaging and accessible format. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the platform features responsive design for cross-device compatibility and prioritizes accessibility with clear visual hierarchy, simplified navigation, and supportive multimedia elements. Integrated NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API to dynamically display daily space imagery and facts. This project emphasized real-world API consumption, DOM manipulation, user-focused design, and collaborative development practices.
